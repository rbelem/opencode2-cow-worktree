/**
 * The `cow` sidebar badge.
 *
 * opencode2's TUI runtime loads this module and provides `@opencode/plugin/tui`
 * and `solid-js` by specifier rewrite — they are not installable dependencies.
 *
 * The value is resolved BEFORE the slot is registered, so the render is a plain
 * constant read. A slot claim is rendered through opencode2's `provide()`,
 * which calls the render function once, untracked and outside any reactive
 * owner: a signal or `<Show>` read inside that render is captured at its
 * initial value and never updates. Resolving first and registering after avoids
 * reactivity in the render entirely.
 *
 * The trade-off: the badge reflects the location at load time. A session that
 * moves between the project root and a worktree mid-session will not re-resolve
 * until the plugin reloads. That is the price of a render that cannot update,
 * and it is the correct call for a decoration that must never break the footer.
