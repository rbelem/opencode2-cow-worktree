 * the refusal table is testable without a filesystem or opencode2. The probe
 * half classifies one session lookup; the file half owns the marker file and
 * the git exclude entry that keeps it out of `git status`.
 *
 * opencode2 sessions persist after completion and carry no status field — the
 * record's `time.updated` (epoch milliseconds) is the only liveness signal a
 * probe gets (verified against 0.0.0-next-20260912.3). Dormancy is therefore a
 * time judgement, not a state read, and the guard fails closed wherever that
 * judgement cannot be made: a probe that errors, and a record whose
 * `time.updated` is missing or unusable, both refuse.
